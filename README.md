# Tat-Vision

Intentionally Retro site for a local artist.

The Artist wanted a 1990s style site to suit the theme. 

The Space Jam site was higlighted as an inspiration for the title layout.

The table layout was used as a template and populated with an array of gifs and links selected by the artist.

I further enhanced the site by adding a css grid video gallery containing links to the artists youtube videos (limited to 12 per page due to the vast number of embeded videos). The gallery also contains further gifs dotted amongst the videos.

Javascript then added to change the gallery to the next set of videos. (none Api method which would admittedly  of made this easier, i could also of just changed the href dynamically as opposed to re adding the entire html blocks)

I then suggested and added a tv static/noise function with a high z index to overlay the page to give the impression that the channel was changing and to hide the embeded load times. 

This was given further visual impact by having the static/noise color change per page. 

Further code comments, linting and optimization required, code handed over in current state to artist who has a friend who controls the domain and hosting.

Live page if used will be at tatvision.com
